# Interactive Comments Section 🗣️

This is my implementation for Frontend Mentor's [Interactive Comments Section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9) challenge.

As requested by the challenge, the section can be experienced both on a desktop and a mobile environment 🧑‍💻.
